 01. Go to file location and Run command "npm install" in the terminale
 02. Call my assesment  app.js file  run the command "node app.js" in the terminale
 03. Pass parameters using argv "node app.js  --greeting  <your greeting as a string>   --who <your who as a string>"  in the terminale
     like this you can pass every arguments using terminale out side of the app.js file (width = number, height = number, color = 'string',
     size = number,)
     
 
 
 
    app.js is my modified Js File.

*   I used axios instead request because it has been deprecated and axios can easily handle requests asynchronously. 
    Among so many features, axios can get the response directly as a Buffer.

*   Using async await, we can avoid the callback hell. Otherwise we would end up with so many nested callbacks. 
    It's just syntactical sugar for JavaScript promises. Until the response event triggers, the thread will be released for other operations.

*   They can handle multiple asynchronous operations easily and provide better error handling than callbacks and events.

*   Moved blend and writeFile callbacks inside Promises. This way we can simply use async await instead callbacks in the main function. 
    This way the code will syntactically look like a synchronous code. This code is more clean, readable and maintainable.
